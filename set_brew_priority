#!/bin/bash

# Purpose: This script prioritizes /usr/local/bin in the PATH environment variable.
# It modifies both ~/.bashrc and ~/.profile to ensure /usr/local/bin is prepended to PATH
# for future shell sessions, and updates the current session's PATH if necessary.
# This is particularly useful for prioritizing locally installed tools (e.g., Homebrew)
# over system-wide versions. The script is idempotent and can be run multiple times safely.
